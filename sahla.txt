Objective: The objective of this practical assignment is to implement a deep learning model using TensorFlow to predict next characters for a sequence of characters. By the end of this assignment, students should have a better understanding of how to develop a model to generate reasonable text sequences for a given text dataset using TensorFlow.

Requirements:

Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x).
TensorFlow installed (you can install it using pip: pip install tensorflow).
Basic knowledge of Python, pandas, and neural networks.
Dataset: For this assignment, you must use the given dataset.

Your task is to generate number of characters for a given text data according to specified requirements as below.

Task Description:

Data Preparation (20 points):
·         Load the dataset.

·         Evaluate the characteristics of the dataset.

·         Prepare inputs and outputs in appropriate format to feed the model.

Model Design (25 points):
·         Implement a model using TensorFlow's to generate next characters for a sequence of 20 characters.

·         Choose an appropriate loss function and optimizer.

Training (20 points):
·         Train your model using character sequences implemented above with 15 epochs and 150 batch sizes.

Evaluation (15 points):
·         Choose 5th training record of the model to do the prediction.

·         For the selected record, predict its next 5 characters and after that, print whole sequence.

Hyperparameter Tuning (5 points):
·         Experiment with hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, batch size) to improve model performance.

·         Report the best set of hyperparameters and their impact on accuracy in the report.

Presentation and Documentation (15 points):
·         Include code comments and explanations for clarity in the Jupyter Notebook.

·         Prepare a brief report (word document) indicating followings

                                - first 10 training dataset for the model and thier respective outputs.

                                - results of the prection

                                - mention your findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
